            </h3>

            <p>About 15 years ago, the coolest thing you could possibly do with a poster you designed was to take a
                picture
                of it in front of your face. If you don’t remember this era, you might remember another like it:
                business
                cards floating in space, stationery in dramatic shadow or objects surrounded by clouds. Mockups like
                these
                have long been integral to the designer’s toolkit, but their role and influence have significantly
                evolved
                over the past decade. We’ve seen a surge in the variety and complexity of mockups, as designers
                increasingly
                innovate and craft more intricate and impactful scenarios – and reshape industry norms in the process.
                This
                shift not only changes how we present our work, but also fundamentally redefines our definition of
                design
                production.</p>

            <p>It’s impractical, if not impossible, for most individuals or small teams to personally create the
                polished
                documentation that the competitive design market demands. Thankfully, there are now dozens of <a
                    href="#s-mockup-producers" class="highlight highlight-yellow">indie mockup producers</a> to
                patronise – such
                as <a href="#s-mockup-producers" class="highlight highlight-yellow">Mock Reality</a>, <a
                    href="#s-mockup-producers" class="highlight highlight-yellow">Layers</a>, <a
                    href="#s-mockup-producers" class="highlight highlight-yellow">Mockup Maison</a>, <a
                    href="#s-mockup-producers" class="highlight highlight-yellow">Darkroom</a> and <a
                    href="#s-mockup-producers" class="highlight highlight-yellow">Various Formats</a> –
                each
                specialising in a particular style, from CGI-rendered minimalism to eclectic surrealist fantasy lands.
                As the bespoke mockup industry expands, the creativity required to distinguish one’s mockups has also
                begun
                to parallel the creativity needed to create a consumer-facing project that will exist in the real world.
                Designers making mockups now need to use the experiences and insights they’ve gained doing client-facing
                work to anticipate market trends and consumer preferences within the design community itself. To appeal
                to creatives shopping for mockups, many producers even go as far as designing entire fictional brands to
                help populate each release. The photos advertising Granada-based Bendito Mockup’s “Call My Barista”
                collection, for example, feature the same kind of retro brand mascots and bold typography one might
                expect to see
                for the identity of an actual, IRL coffee shop. Rather than a mockup being used to sell a piece of
                design,
                here the design is used to sell the mockup.</p>

            <p>In theory, better quality mockups are used to woo better clients. In practice, they’re used just as often
                to
                signal status and insider knowledge to other creatives. Clients may tolerate remarkably basic or even
                subpar
                mockups so long as they fulfil the basic requirement of visualising a concept. Meanwhile, only the
                trained
                eye of a fellow designer or art director would likely appreciate that Mockup Maison’s new “Low Light”
                collection taps into the popular art direction trend of backlit silhouettes, or that Bendito’s
                “Peppinillo
                Social Club” set includes the same kind of silver dishware that’s been dominating brand photoshoots of
                late.
                Mockups have essentially become fetishised objects of obsession within the design community, where the
                use
                of an appropriately zeitgeisty mockup is part of a subliminal dialogue between designers (almost like a
                designer’s version of the business card scene in American Psycho). This kind of subtle peer-to-peer
                judgement isn’t so different from when designers talk shit about a rebrand that uses an overhyped
                typeface,
                even if the client and general public don’t care.</p>

            <p>The benefits of mockups are perhaps most crucial for fresh graduates and early-career designers whose
                work is
                often speculative (we can require students to assemble a book on paper, but we can’t require them to
                produce
                the actual nose art for an aeroplane). Even those young designers who do have fully realised projects
                may
                not want these to make up the bulk of their portfolio anyway. Junior designers are usually relegated to
                production-oriented tasks that require more rule-following than they do creativity; as a result, the
                “real”
                projects these designers could put in their portfolio may not reflect their potential capabilities or
                personal interests.</p>

            <p>
                The expectations we have for young designers entering the workforce have only gotten higher as the
                general
                talent pool becomes more competitive – students must present their work with enough polish to stand out
                amongst more seasoned designers who are job-hunting as a result of lay-offs or a change in career.
                Elaine
                Lopez, associate director of Parson’s undergraduate Communication Design department, emphasises the
                fleeting
                nature of portfolio reviews, noting that employers are typically looking at students’ websites for just
                a
                few seconds. “As a student, your job is to get a job,” she says, “and that means the work needs to
                seduce.”
                Elaine also mentions the potential that mockups hold to educate students on concepts like scale. Though
                we
                both agree that the best way to test the type size and colour of a print design is still to actually
                print
                it out (really!!!), putting your poster design into a billboard mockup can also be an accessible way to
                think about how something will look in the real world (though, as Raf Rennie said on X, “how many people
                have designed an actual billboard vs. the amount of billboard mockups there are?”). Elaine told me she
                even
                knows a few designers who create their work right into a mockup template in order to cut out the
                middleman
                and force themselves to consider final output as soon as possible.

                    <p>My degree project more-or-less came to be thanks to Elizabeth.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was fortunate to have studied under her in my sophomore year; through her I was introduced to
                        <i>It’s Nice That</i>. After I happened upon this writeup early 2025, I couldn’t stop thinking
                        about
                        it. Elizabeth so succintly summed up a part of what I’ve been plagued by subconsciously as I
                        continued my education (my frustration with Big Design™, if you will): a prioritisation of
                        presentation over content which has rendered the design process upside-down into a
                        deliverable/product-oriented one.
