            This website acts as both foundation and companion to Marie You’s BFA Graphic Design Degree Project,
            BEYOND THE SPECTACLE.
            The texts it houses serve as the ideological platform atop which the DP’s explorative designs rest.
            Through a multitude of ways, they question and examine the dominating visual culture as well as
            the “spectacles” it creates.
        </p>
        <p>
            In response to the DP’s goal to develop a more authentic personal practice, the archive utilises a
            hypertext structure rich with annotations and external/internal links which make transparent the
            artist’s lines of inquiry and subsequent personal reflections.

            <h3>Guy Debord
                <br>
                1967 (trans. 1977)
            </h3>
            <h2 style="text-align:center;"><i>“Separation Perfected”</i></h2>
            <p><i>“But certainly for the present age, which prefers the sign to the thing signified,
                    the copy to the original, representation to reality, the appearance to the essence...
                    illusion only is sacred, truth profane. Nay, sacredness is held to be enhanced in proportion
                    as truth decreases and illusion increases, so that the highest degree of illusion comes to be
                    the highest degree of sacredness.”
                </i><br><br>–– Feuerbach, Preface to the second edition of The Essence of Christianity
            </p>
            <p>1.<br>
                In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense
                accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.
            </p>
            <p>2.<br>
                The images detached from every aspect of life fuse in a common stream in which the unity of this life
                can no longer be reestablished. Reality considered partially unfolds, in its own general unity, as a
                pseudo-world apart, an object of mere contemplation. The specialization of images of the world is
                completed in the world of the autonomous image, where the liar has lied to himself. The spectacle in
                general, as the concrete inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the non-living.
