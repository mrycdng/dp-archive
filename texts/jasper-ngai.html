            This website acts as both foundation and companion to Marie You’s BFA Graphic Design Degree Project,
            BEYOND THE SPECTACLE.
            The texts it houses serve as the ideological platform atop which the DP’s explorative designs rest.
            Through a multitude of ways, they question and examine the dominating visual culture as well as
            the “spectacles” it creates.
        </p>
        <p>
            In response to the DP’s goal to develop a more authentic personal practice, the archive utilises a
            hypertext structure rich with annotations and external/internal links which make transparent the
            artist’s lines of inquiry and subsequent personal reflections.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Aesthetics as a philosophical discipline was an invention of the Enlightenment, and appropriately
                enough, most of the historical discussion has focused on the beautiful and the sublime. However, as J.
                L. Austin noted in “A Plea for Excuses,” the classic problems are not always the best site for
                fieldwork
                in aesthetics: <i>“If only we could forget for a while about the beautiful and get down instead to the
                    dainty and the dumpy.”</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Sianne Ngai, a professor in the English department at Stanford University, has dedicated years of
                research to such marginal categories within aesthetics. She is the author of a book on minor affects
                called <i>Ugly Feelings</i> (Harvard University Press, 2005) and several heavily photocopied papers on
                aesthetics, including “The Cuteness of the Avant-Garde” (2005) and “Merely Interesting” (2008). Her
                forthcoming book expands her investigation of apparently trivial but culturally ubiquitous aesthetic
                categories to include the zany. Adam Jasper interviewed Ngai by email.

            <p>AJ:<br>
                You’ve written on cuteness, on envy, on boredom, and now on the interesting. If it could be said
                that there is a unified project behind these topics, what is it?
            </p>
            <p>SN:<br>
                I’m interested in states of weakness: in “minor” or non-cathartic feelings that index situations of
                suspended agency; in trivial aesthetic categories grounded in ambivalent or even explicitly
                contradictory feelings. More specifically, I’m interested in the surprising power these weak affects and
                aesthetic categories seem to have, in why they’ve become so paradoxically central to late capitalist
                culture. The book I’m currently completing is on the contemporary significance of three aesthetic
                categories in particular: the cute, the interesting, and the zany.
