            This website acts as both foundation and companion to Marie You’s BFA Graphic Design Degree Project,
            BEYOND THE SPECTACLE.
            The texts it houses serve as the ideological platform atop which the DP’s explorative designs rest.
            Through a multitude of ways, they question and examine the dominating visual culture as well as
            the “spectacles” it creates.
        </p>
        <p>
            In response to the DP’s goal to develop a more authentic personal practice, the archive utilises a
            hypertext structure rich with annotations and external/internal links which make transparent the
            artist’s lines of inquiry and subsequent personal reflections.

                    … one begins by attacking a Republic, and ends by robbing a stage coach.”

                    In 1966, film director Jaques Rivette conducted an interview with fellow director Jean Renoir (son
                    of
                    Impressionist painter Pierre Auguste Renoir). The videos (Part One and Part Two) display Renoir’s
                    litany
                    of how technical progress in art always ends in a state of decadence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It sometimes makes me wonder whether man’s gift for beauty isn’t in spite of himself. His
                    intelligence
                    — What a devastating force! Intelligence is terrible. It makes us do stupid things. What if
                    intelligence
                    pushes us towards ugliness? What if intelligence makes us slaves, admirers of all that is ugly?
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I wonder whether in primitive times, all objects, not just art, were beautiful. It’s a disturbing
                    question. When we look at ancient Etruscan pottery, it’s all beautiful. And don’t tell me that every
                    Etruscan potter was a genius!
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why is it that when technique is primitive, everything is beautiful, and when technique is
                    perfected, almost everything is ugly, except things created by an artist talented enough to overcome
                    technique?
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s a disturbing question.”
                </p>
            </i>
            <p>
                Disturbing indeed. Especially as it’s easy to see parallels between the everyday productivity of an
                Etruscan potter and today’s designer. And between the way contemporary designers admire vernacular
                typography and (mis-)printing, and how Renoir looks at old pots.
            </p>
            <p>
                These parallels begin to make a case that we, designers for commerce, designers in culture, designers of
                objects and brands, might be in a state of decadence.
