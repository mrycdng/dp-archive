            This website acts as both foundation and companion to Marie You’s BFA Graphic Design Degree Project,
            BEYOND THE SPECTACLE.
            The texts it houses serve as the ideological platform atop which the DP’s explorative designs rest.
            Through a multitude of ways, they question and examine the dominating visual culture as well as
            the “spectacles” it creates.
        </p>
        <p>
            In response to the DP’s goal to develop a more authentic personal practice, the archive utilises a
            hypertext structure rich with annotations and external/internal links which make transparent the
            artist’s lines of inquiry and subsequent personal reflections.

                    There’s a moment</a> in the very first episode <a href="#s-twilight-zone"
                    class="highlight highlight-yellow">The Twilight Zone</a> that I keep thinking about. In many
                ways,
                that first episode establishes the formula for the entire following series. It  features a main
                character who is, unbeknownst to him, already embroiled in a highly unusual situation. It stars a single
                actor, who 
                gives a big, showy, performance. There’s  a twist at the end that recontextualizes what the whole story
                was about. </p>
            <p>
                But in other ways, it stands apart from the series. There is no Rod Serling introduction to this
                episode, no familiar twinkly theme song, no eyeball floating through space. There is, in fact,  no
                supernatural element to the whole episode. And twenty minutes into the show, this happens:
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="setCurrentTime(1)" class="highlight highlight-blue">
                    [00:58] A man sprints down a staircase, seemingly towards the camera, but collides with a
                    mirror.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                This… This might be the most memorable moment of the entire series to me. Yes I remember Maple Street
                and Eye of the Beholder, “room for one more” and “that’s not fair.” But it’s these three seconds, this
                man desperately trying to pass through the looking glass and being violently rejected, that most
                viscerally stick in my brain. The strange fracturing of a fantasy.
            </p>
            <p>The entirety of the episode thus far has been this man wandering through an empty town. The restaurants,
                police stations, and movie theaters are barren. There are hints of life — lit cigarettes in ashtrays,
                functioning projectors, an everpresent feeling of being watched — but no people, and no explanation of
                the desolation. At one point, the man remembers he was in the air force and thinks, maybe there was a
                bomb — maybe it killed everyone. Maybe it killed him. And then he runs into the mirror and he stumbles
                outside and he begs someone, begs anyone, for help. And then we learn the true shape of his world.
            </p>

                    man,</a>
                Sergeant Mike Ferris, is not in an abandoned town, nor is he dead. For the entire time we’ve
                watched him, and for hundreds of hours prior, he has been in a single room — an isolation booth, where
                his entire delusion has been observed by a cohort of uniformed men. This has all been a test, a General
                explains to a group of reporters. And it was successful: the time spent in the isolation booth, hundreds
                of hours alone, is what will be required for a trip to the moon. Ferris, despite his mania, proved the
                ability of humans to last in a room alone. <i>“This is the hardest aspect of endurance,”</i> a medical
                officer
                explains.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>“You see, Ferris, we can feed stomachs with concentrates. We can supply microfilm for recreation,
                    reading, even movies of a sort. We can pump oxygen in, waste material out. 
                    But there's one thing we can't simulate. That's a pretty basic need -- man's hunger for 
                    companionship, the barrier of loneliness.”</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>“This is what’s holding us back,”</i> he says. The next frontier, we understand, will be gated not by
                our strength or beauty or intelligence. <a href="#connection-1" class="highlight highlight-green">The
                    future will be held in an empty room.</a>
            </p>
            <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="setCurrentTime(3)" class="highlight highlight-blue">[03:48] In the
                    opening</a>
                of the 2019 video game, <a href="#s-death-stranding" class="highlight highlight-yellow">Death
                    Stranding</a>... A lot of things happen. We would be here all day if I went
                through the timefall, the BTs, the bridge babies, the beach. The first forty minutes of the game are a
                cavalcade of ideas and imagery, all set where most of the game takes place—wide open, lonely highlands,
                grass and rolling hills and dark cliffs. But after this opening onslaught, Sam, the protagonist, wakes
                up in effectively a cell. He’s handcuffed to the bed in a windowless room. His new friend, Deadman,
                tells him that there’s a job only Sam can do: deliver a package of medicine to his mother. Sam’s
                mother, the president of the United States. His mother, who is being kept in a location referred to
                as <i>“the isolation ward”</i>. Deadman explains all this, and then he... Glitches. His hologram
                shimmers. He’s not
                actually there, see. The room is empty.
            </p>
            <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="setCurrentTime(4)" class="highlight highlight-blue">[04:53] But
                    you’re allowed</a> 
                to exit your cell and walk back into open air, provided you agree to the mission. The
                isolation ward where you have  to deliver the medicine isn’t far away. It’s actually very close, like
                maybe three blocks. Because the walk is so brief, it’s easy to forget how
                bizarre this environment is, where virtually all of the rest of the game takes place in nature or
                individual, closed-off bunkers, the walk through “Central” resembles—well, that first episode of the
                Twilight Zone, actually. It’s an empty main street. Like Ferris in the Twilight Zone, Sam can even
                holler while he walks. Touch a button on the controller and he’ll yell, <i>“Hey!”</i> or <i>“I’m
                    Sam!”</i> or <i>“Anyone there?”</i> Usually, you’d yell this in the middle of nowhere. Sometimes,
                you
                might actually get a response from a nearby player-built structure. But it feels more apt here, among
                the empty streets. And it’s unnerving to hear nothing but your own echo.
            </p>
            <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="setCurrentTime(5)" class="highlight highlight-blue">[05:54] That’s not</a> 
                even what I want to talk about, though. After your jaunt through the empty streets, you’ll
                arrive at the isolation ward, a building that doesn’t seem to live up to its name. What about where I
                just was, huh? Handcuffed to the bed in a windowless room? This by contrast is big and populated, there
                are hallways and people and is that- Is that the Oval Office?!
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, it is. Sam’s mother, Bridget,  is the president, and though she’s literally on her deathbed, that
                bed still lies within the sun-dappled curves of America’s most famous room. The life support cables
                hanging from the ceiling present a potent metaphor:<i> is this the state of America?</i> Its previous
                symbolism corrupted by the unignorable presence of death? Bridget and Sam argue. She wants to rebuild
                the country, reconnect. Sam says there’s nothing to rebuild—<i>“Bridget, you’re the president of jack
                    shit”</i>—and Bridget, then, lunges out of bed. Her life support tubes snap, black goo pours out.
                Sam recoils—forget the medical horror, forget the attack by a near-dead woman—this is the first time
                he’s been touched, by anyone, in the entire game. She begs him again to help. She dies. And as she
                flatlines, it seems the room itself does too. Half the population of the office reveal themselves to be
                holograms as they blink out of existence. The furniture disappears from the walls. The sun disappears
                from the windows, the windows themselves shudder into a gray void. There was no oval office, no last
                gasp of American ascendancy. The metaphor 
                was much more potent than some simple life support cables. This is the true image of the country: three
                people and a corpse in an empty room.
            </p>
            <p><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="setCurrentTime(6)" class="highlight highlight-blue">[07:51] This is</a> 
                a fitting introduction to the future proposed by Death Stranding, a future where “connection” is both 
                dangerous to attempt and difficult to argue for. Everything has been reconfigured for isolation:
                immediately after Bridget dies, Sam is tasked with hauling his mother’s body to the crematorium. The
                massive concrete structure is, predictably, empty. Sam pushes a button and watches her incineration,
                alone.

                            Geller, through video game analysis, nonetheless posits what is essentially the ideas
                            shared by other writers in this archive: that reality has been subsumed by representations
                            of
                            that
                            reality—becoming a lush room that ultimately rings hollow. More significantly, he discusses
                            the ramifications of such shallowness: an ever-increasing magnitude of human loneliness as
                            we retreat into illusion. I’m glad to have discovered this, because Geller brings to the
                            table what conversations confined to a design perspective cannot.
